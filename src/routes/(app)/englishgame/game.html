You're an experienced child psychologist, English teacher, game designer, senior product designer, and front-end developer.
I have a My Little Pony text adventure game made for kids.
The game progresses through chats between the player and the game. There are many choices and challenges, and players need to make decisions and give answers.
The game is designed for children, so please make it cute and appealing.
Please use H5 to develop this game.
